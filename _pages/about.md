I'm Junfei Wu, a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence), advised by Prof. Tieniu Tan. I also collaborate closely with Prof. Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, and Liang Wang. My research centers on **trustworthy and interpretable reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)**, with a focus on **spatial reasoning, hallucination detection, and test-time adaptation**.

I interned at Ant Group’s Multimodal LLM team, where I developed the “Drawing to Reason in Space” framework to enhance visual thinking in LVLMs—published at NeurIPS 2025. I also pioneered representation-based hallucination mitigation techniques (EMNLP 2025) and logic-consistency-based detection frameworks (ACL 2024 Findings).

When not debugging tensors, I enjoy playing basketball, badminton, table tennis, yo-yo, or solving a Rubik’s Cube.
